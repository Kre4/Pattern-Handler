### Path to the each file can be set manually, but there is default ones in debug 
+ ***pattern.txt*** is used for pattern ~~(surprisingly)~~/template, which looks like
```
Text {parameter1} text {parameter2} text {*parameter3}
```
+ ***params.json*** is used for getting params. Example:
```
{
  "parameter1": "Kre4",
  "parameter2": "Hello World",
  "parameter3": "Goodbuy World"
}
```
+ ***result.txt***. Hope it's understanable for what is this file used )
+ ***LogGile.txt***. Here you can find the reason of uncorrectable work of the program.
